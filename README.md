# BinaryToDecimal
I was hired to build a converter of binary numbers into decimals, but this time the conversion must be done manually, that is, without using formulas or ready-made functions that perform the conversion. You must build an algorithm that takes a string containing a binary number and returns the corresponding decimal value.
