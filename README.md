# 🧮 Binary to Decimal Converter
This is a simple project that allows you to convert binary numbers to decimal numbers using JavaScript and React.

# 🔁 If you're interested, I have also implemented a similar project using TypeScript without React.

## Features
Accepts input of binary numbers.
Performs conversion from binary to decimal.
Displays the converted result in decimal format.
Prerequisites
Installed Node.js
npm or Yarn installed
How to Use
Clone the repository or download the files.

Open the terminal and navigate to the project's root directory.

Install project dependencies by running the following command:

npm install
or
yarn install
Start the application by running the following command:

npm start
or
yarn start
The application will open in your default browser. You will see an input field where you can enter a binary number. Upon clicking the "Convert" button, the binary number will be converted to decimal, and the result will be displayed on the screen.

Try entering different binary numbers and observe the results.
